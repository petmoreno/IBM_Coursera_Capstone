    "A client is looking to open an Pizza Place (PP) in Toronto and he/she doesn't know where to open it although a neighborhood with no PP among their top venues is aimed.  Thus, by using the foursquare api we will explore the top5 most common venues in each neighborhood to see which neighborhood lacks from an PP. To increase the chances of succeed in the business the target neighborhood should have closer neighborhood where an PP is in the most common venues."

    "### a. Prepraring the dataframe with Toronto's neighborhoods and its coordinates\n",
    "To import the data about Toronto's neighborhood along with their coordinates, the following links are used: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n",
    "\n",
    "For importing the tables we use pandas package in both cases and the following methods:\n",
    "--code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\")\n",
    "pd.read_csv('http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Those rows that contains the value 'Not assigned' in Borough's column are removed and values of 'not assigned' in Neighborhood's column are replaced by the Borough values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before merging the latitude and longitude of each neighborhood, the data frame is grouped by Postcode and Borough, by using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "     return Series(dict(Neighbourhood = \"%s\" % ', '.join(x['Neighborhood'])))\n",
    "df=df.groupby(['Postcode','Borough']).apply(f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The resulting dataframe is obtained by using \n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.merge(df,df_latlon, on='Postcode')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Finding top venues as restaurants in Toronto\n",
    "#### 1. Download and Explore Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a graphic idea of the distribution of neighbourhoods, we use folium package where Toronto's map is shown and neighbourhoods are marked with blue circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explore Neighborhoods\n",
    "We will use Foursquare API to get venues of each neighborhoods with radius param of 800 (meters) and limit=150.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Filtering only Restaurant and food places venues\n",
    "We are only interested in restaurants and food places. Thus, we explore the values of 'Venue Category' column and create a new dataframe with only restaurants and food places as venues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhoods analysis\n",
    "#### 4. Analizing each Neighborhood\n",
    "The 5 top venues for each neighborhood are get from the Toronto's restaurants dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Cluster Neighborhoods\n",
    "We will create 5 clusters by using the k-means algorithms. Next, to be able to depict the cluster distribution on a Toront map we will create a new data frame by merging the lat long coordinates of a neighborhood, the 5 top restaurant venues of it and the cluster where it belongs. Then, by using folium maps in the similar way as before the 5 cluster are depicted with colour distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Examine Clusters and decide on which neighborhood install our pizza place\n",
    "Finally we will filter the different neighborhoods in each cluster to see which one lacks of a Pizza place. Those neighborhoods selected will be our candidates."

    "After having the results we are in the position to evaluate the feasibility of our system. Here are some ideas to be discussed:\n",
    "1. Among a total of 103 neighborhood that exist in Toronto 46 six of them have not a Pizza Place in their 5 top restaurant venues.\n",
    "2. The clustering technique allow us to refine the neighbourhood candidates to install our Pizza Place since in every clusters except cluster 3 we have no more than 5 options of choice.\n",
    "3. The Cluster 3 has 37 optional neighborhood which seems unbearable to make a decision. Therefore, a finer processing in this cluster has to be made in order decrease the amount of options. The criteria of such finer processing could be the vicinity of other entertainment venues such as casinos, sport arenas,etc.\n",
    "4. As we have get a total of 46 neighborhoods candidates which is quite a lot to make a decision, we can say that our system is not quite feasible for finding a neighborhood to install a Pizza Place. Thus, we can check if the system is better for another kind of restaurant."
