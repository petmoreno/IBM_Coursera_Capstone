    "A client is looking to open an Italian Restaurant (IR) in Toronto and he/she doesn't know where to open it although a neighborhood with no IR among their top venues is aimed.  Thus, by using the foursquare api we will explore the top5 most common venues in each neighborhood to see which neighborhood lacks from an Italian restaurant. To increase the chances of succeed in the business the target neighborhood should have closer neighborhood where an Italian Restaurant is in the most common venues."
