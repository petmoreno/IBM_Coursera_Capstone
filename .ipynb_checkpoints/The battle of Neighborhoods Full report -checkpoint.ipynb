    "A friend of mine is thinking about opening an Italian Restaurant (IR) in Chicago. She doesn't know where to open it and ask me for help to explore in which Toronto's neighborhood the venue will have more chances of succedding. Thus, by using the foursquare api we will explore the top5 most common venues in each neighborhood to see which neighborhood lacks from an Italian restaurant and has close neighborhod where an Italian Restaurant is in the most common venues. This assumption is based on if a neighborhood lacks from a IR and its closer neighborhoods have their IR as top venues, our Restaurant will succeed."
